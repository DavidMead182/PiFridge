# PiFridge

PiFridge is a **soft real-time IoT fridge monitoring system** built on a **Raspberry Pi**.  
It continuously tracks **true fridge temperature and humidity** and logs **food items** as they are placed into the fridge using **barcode scanning or manual input**. All data is accessible through a **web application**.

This project is designed for **educational, research, and open-source experimentation** in real-time systems, IoT, and web-based monitoring.
